Pokemon Teams API

This is a simple API that allows you to create and manage Pokemon teams.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.

Once cloned, you may want to create a virtual environment for the project. You can do so by running the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Installing

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the server
